In order to commemorate my high school career and record my training as a biology major.
There is conclude all my project in senior high. To commemorate my high school career and document the process of my training in the field of life sciences, I have divided it mainly into two parts: academic coursework and extracurricular activities (such as the Biology Research Club).

The academic coursework includes all reports I have prepared from my freshman year to my senior year in high school.

The extracurricular activities refer to the content I designed for the Biology Research Club, starting from my sophomore year when I took on the role of teaching coordinator.

Hope youth never forget, cheers.
